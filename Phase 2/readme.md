## Lexical Analyzer ##

Lexical analysis is the first phase of a compiler. It takes the modified source code from
language preprocessors that are written in the form of sentences. The lexical analyzer breaks
these syntaxes into a series of tokens, by removing any whitespace or comments in the source
code.
